@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the uC/OS-II-v2.91 on the STM32F4xx devices.

Two tasks work in this example:
   - App_TaskStar  Control the LED blinking
   - App_TaskKbd   Control the LED blinking frequency by User button pressing

if the Demon run ok
   - LEDs will be blink as follow : LED4 -> LED6 -> LED5 -> LED3
   - press the User button, change blinking speed of the LEDs

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  + This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
  
  + Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60

  + Hardware Set-up 
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Use the Key user-button

         
@par How to use it ?    

  1. Download uC/OS-II-v2.91 source code.
     You can get it on the Micrium website.As below:
     http://micrium.com/page/downloads/source_code
     Copy uC/OS-II-v2.91 source from the Micrium folder(Micrium\Software\uCOS-II\Source) to Project folder(STM32F4xx_uCOSII_Example\uCOS-II\Source).
     
  2. Load the demonstration code in the STM32F4x7 Flash memory (see below)

  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)
