@par Example Description 

     This example project describes how to test LCD module on  STM32F4DIS-BB board.

     The red,green,blue ribbon appear on the LCD.

     The LCD driver support all bpp values. The example tests 16bpp.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
     - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
     - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module
	 
  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60
  
  - Hardware Set-up 
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
