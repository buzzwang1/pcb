@par Example Description 

This example provides a example of how to use the SDIO firmware library and
an associate driver to implement Fatfs on the SD Card memory.

@par Directory contents 

  - "inc": contains the project firmware header files    
    - inc/stm32f4xx_conf.h     Library Configuration file
    - inc/stm32f4xx_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file

  - "src": contains the project firmware source files
    - src/system_stm32f4xx.c   STM32F4xx system clock configuration file
    - src/stm32f4xx_it.c       Interrupt handlers
    - src/main.c               Main program

  The FatFs file directory is under Utilities\FatFs_vR0.08a
  
@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
     - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
     - TF card (2GB or less than 2GB Kingston or SanDisk TF Card is recommended. 
       It should be formatted before using)
     - Hyperterminal 
	 
  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60
	
  - Hardware Set-up 
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Insert a TF card into microSD slot CON6
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      COM1 (USART6) and PC serial port
      @note Make sure that jumper
            JP1: ON 
            JP2: ON
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
      
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None         
    
@par How to use it ? 

  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)
